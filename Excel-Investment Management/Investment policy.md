### In the previous prompt, you had to compute the lowest (and highest) expected yearly returns in 68% of the time by subtracting (and adding) one standard deviation to the yearly average return. This means that in 68% of the time over the past 11 years, the SAAs have delivered a yearly return that was between these two values if we assume the returns of the SAAs were normally distributed.

### Knowing that equities, bonds, and cash are primary assets (and so is any combination of them), would you say that it was appropriate to make such an assumption? Why?

  It is not entirely appropriate to assume normal distribution of returns for equities, bonds, and cash, which is often asymmetric and may exhibit skewness and fat tails more than perfect symmetry as required for the normal distribution.


### Your client asks you the following questions: Is there any relationship between the expected return of the SAAs and the size of the range that goes from the lowest to the highest expected return in 68% of the time? If yes, what is the nature of this relationship (positive, negative)?

  Yes, it is a positive relationship as the expected return of the SAAs increases.
The size of the range between the lowest and highest expected returns in 68% of the time also tends to increase.

### Erika Kozlov wants an expected yearly gain of more than USD 3,500,000. What is the appropriate SAA for your client?

  The summary statistics computed in prompt 4, the Conservative SAA is most appropriate for Daviana Turner, the Aggressive SAA for Erika Kozlov, and the balanced SAA for John Lam.

Hello Erika,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I have carefully analyzed your investment objectives and your risk tolerance

Erika, based on your goal of maximizing long-term growth and your high risk tolerance, I recommend adopting an aggressive tactical asset allocation. This approach prioritizes equities and allows us to adjust your portfolio to take advantage of strong market conditions.

From our analysis using 11 years of simulated data, this aggressive TAA strategy delivered the highest average annual returns among all options, but also came with more frequent and larger short-term losses. Historically, the worst annual loss did not exceed $3.6 million, and most years saw strong positive performance.

If you are comfortable with these higher swings in portfolio value in exchange for greater growth potential, this strategy is suitable for you. We will regularly monitor and adjust your allocations to manage risks and capture new opportunities as they arise.

Let me know if you would like to discuss the details further or see more data behind these results.
